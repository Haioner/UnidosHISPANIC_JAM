  - Welcome! You must be the new legend writer.
  - Your job is to manage the legends, keeping them alive.
  - Use souls to fulfill the legends' requests, and earn more souls when the legends
    take souls from humans.
  - Remember to keep at least one legend alive, or no more legends will want to sign
    up...
  - Oh, and don't let humanity reproduce too much, or they'll become the majority
    and start hunting the legends!
  - For now, you only have 1 legend book, which can hold 10 legends, but in the future,
    you can get more books.
